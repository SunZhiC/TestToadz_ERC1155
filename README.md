TestToadz - ERC-1155 NFT Testnet Faucets

Inspired by this Git repository [TestToadz](https://github.com/bokkypoobah/TestToadz)

Due to the closure of some test networks, it is recommended to deploy test contracts on new test networks and additional networks to facilitate testing.

The SameToadz smart contract at [0x07e5ce0f8f](https://etherscan.io/address/0x07e5ce0f8fa46031a1dcc8cb2530f0a52019830d#code) has been renamed to [TestToadz](contracts/TestToadz.sol), compiled with [OpenZeppelin v4.8.3](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/releases/tag/v4.8.3) and deployed on the following testnets:

|  Network   | Contract Address  |
|  ----  | ----  | 
| [Ethereum Goerli](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xb1ecef869cd9382ae17efb07bd813d49832ea6c1#writeContract)  | 0xb1ecef869cd9382ae17efb07bd813d49832ea6c1 | 


Mint up to 5 TestToadz a time (with a maximum of 40 per account) by clicking Connect to Web3 (select appropriate testnet) on the appropriate EtherScan testnet page listed above, entering a quantity between 1 and 5, enter an amount equal or more than 1 in the mint(...) function, to clicking Write and confirming the transaction.

"quantity" represents the number of NFT token IDs to be minted, while "amount" represents the quantity to be minted for each token ID.

You may find these ERC-1155 NFTs useful for your your testing.
